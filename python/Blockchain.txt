Blockchain layout

1) Users. ex jaxx light client, nodes connected, transactional


2) Nodes - not just users, verify validity, rebroadcast, keep a copy, peer to peer relay system
			not benefited when run, but outcome preferred is achieved

3) Miners: bulild chain, finalize transaction and operate as a node
	done in pools to gather stronger power vs just one computer
	4 types: CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC

a block consists of coinbase (accumluation and old blocks), timestamp, difficulty adjustment

1000KB per block max

address is public key, only private key can decode and change the value of public key

Bob sends alice a message (Hello World) then got encrpted to a random numbers, alice can only read it with her private keywall

wallet:
1) software wallet (phone, computer) own private key

2) Web wallet (web browser, ie blockchain.info) don;t have private keys (provideer has)

3) full node wallet - like software wallet but have to run a node

4) paper wallet - generate address offline and send funds there, consist of public key and private key
